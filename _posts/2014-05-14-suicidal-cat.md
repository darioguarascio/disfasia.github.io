A little poem inspired by both Tim Burton's _The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories_ and a melancholic old friend. 


> One night, i saw a cat sitting on the shore  
> Cute and pretty, but there was much more  
>  
> She was hungry and meowing so loud  
> I thought she wanted to wishper to a cloud   
>  
> I took a closer look and i almost fell down  
> She was moving to the water, willing to drown  
>  
> Running so hard my heart was leaving the chest  
> And it did, when i saw the shape of a breast  
>  
> Rattling, i took that flash from the ground  
> Cause it was the only food there i found  
>  
> Could a heart be this cat tastes match?  
> I tried, but i got only a scratch
